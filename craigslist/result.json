Our consultants understand that each student has a unique background and a unique set of challenges and goals; we work intimately with families to help each individual student overcome those challenges and achieve their goals.\n \nAdditionally, FLEX is planning significant domestic and international expansion in the next 12-18 months, providing employees with many opportunities for growth and advancement.

I travel out of town usually 2-3 times per month, somewhere around 8-12 days. Some months more, some less. It would mean staying at our house (including overnight) while I am out of town) Daughter is 16 (almost 17) but very mature and old soul. She needs very little \"supervision\" but really just support with tasks while I am gone. She needs to be taken to and from school morning and afternoon. School is literally right around the corner, minutes away. She sometimes needs rides to activities, until she gets her license, probably in the next month or two. I need the person in this position to make dinners some nights, sometimes it's OK to just order delivery/takeout. We try to eat healthy, so knowledge of healthy cooking is a plus. I will provide groceries and pay for any takeout/delivery meals for the person we choose. The puppy gets fed 3 times daily, walked if you so desire (she likes that), but mostly is a mellow pup who sleeps quite a bit! She needs to be taken out 3 times per day to do her business in her pen in the yard. We have wireless, TV, etc., all available. It's a great gig for someone who can work from \"home,\" not much to do each day. The puppy can be left in her crate for 2-3 hours at a time if the person we choose needs to leave and do things. It wouldn't work well for someone who needs to work for any length of time away from the daughter/puppy. Daughter is very independent and a teenager, so she likes space! Our house is very nice and has a pool. No parties, no guests. The pay rate is $50/day. I need someone who can commit to ALL the hours I need, no negotiation on that, and I want someone who is willing to commit over time. I need someone able to do this for the next year or so if it works out for us all. Please answer telling us why this works for you and why you think you would be GREAT at it. We will set a few interviews from that and decide based on that. Many thanks!    "},

Let me be clear on this point: that is a flat rate, not based on sales or commissions. Some conditions apply.  Unfortunately there are no benefits as this is an entry level position.  Most people start with ZERO experience.  New team members always say our simple, fun training gives them all the confidence they need.  We look for people that want to improve their resume and communication skills, not just those who want to make money (we DO offer pay-raises for top performers).  Hours are 100% flexible: days/evenings/weekends/part time/& more.\n\n\nNo experience is required, but we do find that people who have experience as a server, golf caddy, cashier, hostess, salon receptionists, fast food worker, call center operator, or retail associate do well with our company. Since the position involves working with people, even if someone doesn't have any prior experience, they will gain great resume experience and build up their communication skills. \n\n\nWe find it a lot easier and faster for our applicants to be scheduled over text message. So, once you fill out an application, expect a text from one of our receptionists to continue the interview process.\n\n \n\n    "},

We are real people, doing real deals, and doing very well in this market but want to do more.  As senior members of the club for the over 5 years, we have been very successful teaching others to work alongside us, helping them to get their start in this business closing deals and splitting profits.  \n \nWe are not looking for everyone to join us. This business takes time, determination, and persistence. This is NOT a get rich quick or network marketing or MLM system. Having a current job to help pay your bills until you close your first deal is not only important, but necessary.\n \nPeople who want to learn this business are usually concerned about what it takes to get started.  Not having the capital to buy a house is usually the biggest concern.  What most people need is a team, and one that already has the resources available to plug into, allowing you to ride on the coattails of those more experienced. Our office has everything needed to close real estate transactions such as: \n  \n\u2022\tTitle/ Escrow  \n\u2022\tTransaction Coordinators   \n\u2022\tBank Negotiators  \n\u2022\tReal Estate Agents \n\u2022\tReal Estate Attorneys \n\u2022\tContractors\n\u2022\tCapital to fund deals \n  \nWe are currently expanding in different cities and looking for individuals with entrepreneurial drive and determination to build a business for themselves.  Most people start on a part-time basis, leaning on others credibility until they can close deals, build their network and replace their primary income.  \n  \nThere's a lot of great deals in So Cal, and how to find those deals is what we teach. Below are the strategies we are currently using:  \n  \n\u2022\tFix n Flips  \n\u2022\tWholesale  \n\u2022\tForeclosures  \n\u2022\tShort Sales  \n\u2022\tProbate  \n\u2022\tLease Options etc  \n\u2022\tVacant Houses  \n\u2022\tProperty Tax Defaults \n \n*NO REAL ESTATE LICENSE OR EXPERIENCE IS REQUIRED.  \n \n   \n  \nThe key to growth is surrounding yourself with people who are already doing what you want to do. Starting this business is about leverage.  You are looking to leverage what we already have to help you get started.  In turn, we are looking to leverage you to close more deals.  In the process, we get paid when we close deals, splitting profits, and helping you to build your own business.  As club members, we have many benefits that have led to us closing over 100 deals in the past few years. \n\nYou don't need capital to buy a house or experience, but you will have to dedicate time and effort to make money in this business.  Unlike the TV shows and real estate seminars, we do actually tell you that it is impossible to make money overnight.  \n\nWe get together several times a month in multiple locations including, Riverside, Irvine, Oceanside and Los Angeles. Our system has a proven record for many years now. What we do has afforded us the opportunity to help others get to their first deal and more. \n\nIf you want to partner with experienced investors who can bring the capital and systems to the table, and are the type of person that wants to run your own business at some point, we should talk. Keep in mind, we are very busy and a large reason for placing this ad is to meet the right people looking to get started in this business who see the value of creating partnerships. \n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we have you're info, we'll follow up within 48 hours.\n***NOTE***\nWe are looking for potential Business Partners, not EMPLOYEES. Only contact me if you are serious. If you are currently unemployed and need money fast, now is not the right time for you.

We specialize in applying marketing technology and accounting to PPC. We offer hand-coded landing pages, CRM's, hand management, and on-site meetings no matter where the client is located. We manage our accounts differently. We tell our clients to ignore cost per lead. We report every dollar of profit back to AdWords in real time and optimize on that. (Like eCommerce ROI reporting but for lead gen, we can't wait to show you how cool this is)\n\nWe have some smaller local accounts for when we get bored, but the majority are larger businesses eager for profit. We advise clients not just on marketing, but on accounting, margin, and sales models. We provide email marketing automation (hand coded by us, no WYSIWYG nonsense) and a whole bunch of other things to facilitate PPC.\n\nWe don't have a model where we rapidly onboard accounts. We believe that fewer accounts that pay more money justifies allocating more work hours to each account. Each manager is responsible for up to 10 to 15 accounts, maximum. We meet clients by phone conference weekly, so you should have some degree of communication and sales skills. (We don't expect you to sell, unless you want to.)\n\nWe're not interested in your book of business - keep it for yourself. We only want your brain (if it's decent and comes with a good personality). We WANT you to manage your own accounts from work, we WANT you to be involved in outside business.\n\nWe pay you well and it's based on your current skill set. Whatever you don't know we'll teach you. We go beyond PPC into marketing theory, accounting, and business/sales management.\n\nWe offer our services for AdWords and Amazon (okay, and sometimes Bing but we hate it just like everyone else). We do Facebook too, but not as much.\n\nREQUIRED SKILLS:\nWorking experience/history in AdWords accounts that you can demonstrate.\nHistory in business ownership/management (even if you failed) OR accounting.\n$45,000 plus 5% of gross revenue on accounts managed by you.\n\nQUALIFYING HIRING BONUS AND IMMEDIATE RAISE - +$10,000 Salary, $2,000 bonus:\nAccounting degree or equivalent, certification of accounting course, etc. \nBASIC knowledge of HTML/CSS, PHP/MySQL, and/or Photoshop (this is a non-coding job, but you will have to check things out from time-to-time)\n$55,000 plus 7-10% of gross revenue on accounts managed by you.\n\nWANT TO SELL YOUR OWN ACCOUNTS?\nIt's optional. You get 20% of first month management fees, depending on agreement term, in addition to the commission if you manage it too.\n\nPAY INCREASE:\nDon't have the accounting or coding skills? If we hire you and you take classes, we will offer you the raise and pay (reimburse) you for the classes. We WANT to pay you more money over time - it means you're worth it to us and won't ever leave.\n\nWE START EARLY. WE WORK HARD.\nWork hours are 6:30am to 3:30pm, M-F. Can you hang?\n\nWe buy you health insurance after 90 days. \n\nNO WORK EXPERIENCE? NO PROBLEM\nApply anyway, we might just hire you.\n\nWANNA KNOW WHAT THIS JOB REALLY IS?\nIt's high-pressure, but pretty fun.\nIt's a mix of highs and lows, disappointment and elation in perfect proportions.\nIt's only for smart people and smart clients. Otherwise we aren't interested.\nIt's a small team of guys who love money, love ideas, and love tech (and sometimes our significant others)\nWe are compulsive obsessors.\nAlso, parking is pretty easy. \n\n\n::::: NOTE: THIS IS AN IN-HOUSE POSITION ONLY. NO REMOTE EMPLOYEES.\n\nWe will test your skills. Your test results dictate our offer to you. We don't play low-ball games. We'll offer you what you're worth, then we'll make you worth more, then we'll pay you what your worth. No bullshit.\n\nRESPOND WITH A RESUME AND A SAMPLING OF YOUR PERSONALITY IN THE BODY OF THE EMAIL.\nIMPRESS US, PLEASE.    "},

You should have arrived here because you saw our job posting and decided to take action! It's our hope that you are exactly the person we are looking for so we can take this page down immediately and offer you the fun and rewarding position we have available. \nSo, let me tell you about me, my company, and the job itself. \n\nMy name is Irma Sandoval and I run three fitness facilities located in the West La mid-city area. \nOur business is dedicated to helping women and men achieve their health, fitness, and performance goals through customized fitness and nutrition programs.  \n\nWe're looking for an enthusiastic, motivated, hard working, and energetic person to help handle our office work operations.  \n\nWe have  one location in 8885 Venice Blvd 203 La CA 90034\n\nWe currently offer semi-private, small group, and large group fitness and nutrition programs which motivate, educate, and support men, women, and teens to improve their health, fitness, and performance. All clients start with a minimum initial 2 week Fast Start program which includes: nutrition counseling, fitness and mobility testing, body composition analysis, and weekly training sessions. \n\nIf you are accepted for this position, you will be working M-F (some Saturdays) during our business hours at a rate of $11 per hour for the first 90 days. Continued employment and compensation will be based on performance and job scope.  Hours TBD. \n\nTasks We Need You To Perform \n  \nMaking Great First Impressions: In many cases, you will be the first person a customer, potential customer, or visitor interacts with. Whether you are answering the door, replying to emails or answering and returning phone calls, you'll be responsible for making sure everyone gets the information they need and feel taken care of from the moment they first interact with you. \n\nAnswering and returning phone calls from customers and prospects: You will be the first point of contact for all prospective clients and customers. Also, when you're not here to answer the phone, many of the calls will go to voicemail. You'll be responsible for returning those calls the next day.  \nResponding to customer service phone calls and emails: We get quite a few phone calls and email every day. I am very big on customer service. You will need to respond to each of these within 24 hours or next business day with basic information that we'll provide to you. So you must be comfortable with the phone, using email, and be a good typist.  \nFiling: Basic stuff to keep up with the paper flow.  \nClient and Trainer Scheduling: You will be in charge of updating any changes on a client's and trainer's schedule on a daily basis into our company software.  \nRequired Skills \n\nThese are the skills you must already have in order to qualify for this position: \n  \nA \"Stewardship Mentality\": You will be taking care of our customers and prospective customers. They are all VERY important, so you must be comfortable conversing on the phone, in person, and through email.  You must be relentless in finding solutions for them. We'll teach you the basics of what to say and do, but we can't teach you how to have a great attitude and a strong desire to help people. \nMicrosoft Word: You must be very comfortable using Word  \nMicrosoft Excel: You must have basic Excel skills - you won't have to do anything advance with this software, just some simple spreadsheets, but you must be comfortable doing what we need you to do.  \nGood Phone Personality/Etiquette: You will be talking with our clients and customers, who are VERY important to us, and prospective customers, who are also important! You must be comfortable conversing on the phone, in person, and through email. You must know how to conduct yourself professionally, take clear messages, and deliver clear instructions to the prospect or client. We'll teach you everything you need to say and do, but we can't teach you manners and professionalism.  \nCustomer Service and People Skills: You must have a natural ability or \"servant hood\" mentality, positive attitude, and have impeccable people skills.  \nEmail: A great deal of your work will be via email. We use a web-based program that's easy to learn (you'll understand it within 30 minutes). You must be very comfortable and proficient with email.  \nThoughtfulness and Organization: We need you to be able to think for yourself and be organized. I am very serious about this one! I do not want a robot, I want someone who learns and grows with our company.  \nAttention to Detail: This is a must! You will need to catch the little things from scheduling, to wording, numbers, cleaning, etc. \nFlexibility: We are a small business and as such things change very fast.  So we need someone that can adapt to change on the fly.  \nBonus Skills  \nIf you have these additional skills, your resume will go right to the top of the stack (but if you don't have these skills, you should still apply because these are not mandatory). \nAdobe Creative Suite/Graphic Design: We publish a monthly newsletter and special announcement flyers in publisher, and you'll need to be able to go in and make edits/changes to the file when necessary and get it ready to print  \nMindbody and Photoshop a huge plus\nEditing and Cropping Pictures: We take before and after photos to be used as social proof and testimonials for our company. \n\nHow To Apply \n  \nWe're looking to hire the right person as soon as possible for the WL- Mid-city locations and mainly from 12pm - 8 pm, with some weekends. So if this job sounds good to you, follow these instructions now. \n\nHere's what I want from you. NOTE: Failure to follow these instructions will result in your resume going in the circular file. This is your first test, okay? \nWrite a resume that includes your education, ALL prior work experience (yes, we even want to know if you mowed lawns when you were 14), and any skills you have. It should be 1 or 2 pages in length, but no longer. \nWrite me a 100-250 word (we will count) cover letter explaining why you are the perfect person to fill this position. Include full contact information (name, address, phone, email) on this cover letter.  Also include our core value of Delivering Fun in the first paragraph of this letter (explain how you have delivered fun in past positions or how you will with our organization). \nOn a separate sheet of paper list at least three references with phone numbers and what your relationship is with the references (i.e. - previous employer, college professor, etc). \nPut the cover letter on top of your resume and the reference sheet underneath your resume, staple together in the top left corner. \nSend resume to by forwarding it to this post for fast reponse!\nMail to: Attention Future Fitness family, Fitness Transformation Academy LLC 8885 Venice Blvd 203 La CA 90034\nYou can also respond to this post and forward it but you must provide it in a Word/PDF document and it must be in the same format as listed above.

If we feel you're a good prospect, we'll call or email you to set up a personal interview. \n\nThe sooner we get your resume, the better. This will not be a long, drawn out process. I believe in taking action quickly. So get your resume over to me pronto! I look forward to reviewing it and hopefully meeting you personally. \n\nAgain, thanks very much for your interest.  \n\nYours in Health, \nIrma Sandoval\n    "},

We are real people, doing real deals, and doing very well in this market but want to do more.  As senior members of the club for the over 5 years, we have been very successful teaching others to work alongside us, helping them to get their start in this business closing deals and splitting profits.  \n \nWe are not looking for everyone to join us. This business takes time, determination, and persistence. This is NOT a get rich quick or network marketing or MLM system. Having a current job to help pay your bills until you close your first deal is not only important, but necessary.\n \nPeople who want to learn this business are usually concerned about what it takes to get started.  Not having the capital to buy a house is usually the biggest concern.  What most people need is a team, and one that already has the resources available to plug into, allowing you to ride on the coattails of those more experienced. Our office has everything needed to close real estate transactions such as: \n  \n\u2022\tTitle/ Escrow  \n\u2022\tTransaction Coordinators   \n\u2022\tBank Negotiators  \n\u2022\tReal Estate Agents \n\u2022\tReal Estate Attorneys \n\u2022\tContractors\n\u2022\tCapital to fund deals \n  \nWe are currently expanding in different cities and looking for individuals with entrepreneurial drive and determination to build a business for themselves.  Most people start on a part-time basis, leaning on others credibility until they can close deals, build their network and replace their primary income.  \n  \nThere's a lot of great deals in So Cal, and how to find those deals is what we teach. Below are the strategies we are currently using:  \n  \n\u2022\tFix n Flips  \n\u2022\tWholesale  \n\u2022\tForeclosures  \n\u2022\tShort Sales  \n\u2022\tProbate  \n\u2022\tLease Options etc  \n\u2022\tVacant Houses  \n\u2022\tProperty Tax Defaults \n \n*NO REAL ESTATE LICENSE OR EXPERIENCE IS REQUIRED.  \n \n   \n  \nThe key to growth is surrounding yourself with people who are already doing what you want to do. Starting this business is about leverage.  You are looking to leverage what we already have to help you get started.  In turn, we are looking to leverage you to close more deals.  In the process, we get paid when we close deals, splitting profits, and helping you to build your own business.  As club members, we have many benefits that have led to us closing over 100 deals in the past few years. \n\nYou don't need capital to buy a house or experience, but you will have to dedicate time and effort to make money in this business.  Unlike the TV shows and real estate seminars, we do actually tell you that it is impossible to make money overnight.  \n\nWe get together several times a month in multiple locations including, Riverside, Irvine, Oceanside and Los Angeles. Our system has a proven record for many years now. What we do has afforded us the opportunity to help others get to their first deal and more. \n\nIf you want to partner with experienced investors who can bring the capital and systems to the table, and are the type of person that wants to run your own business at some point, we should talk. Keep in mind, we are very busy and a large reason for placing this ad is to meet the right people looking to get started in this business who see the value of creating partnerships. \n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we have you're info, we'll follow up within 48 hours.\n***NOTE***\nWe are looking for potential Business Partners, not EMPLOYEES. Only contact me if you are serious. If you are currently unemployed and need money fast, now is not the right time for you.
